# Introduction to the AI Data Pipeline {#docs-internal-guid-d0b843f4-90f5-6854-ecbd-be45abfc36e4}

Digitizing a manufacturing operation and leveraging data at scale are critical to discovering actionable insights and realizing value.

In order to create a digital twin of a company’s production, by automatically combining process and quality data from every plant and supplier, the following elements are required:

* Facility and machine configurations

* Data warehousing processes

* Descriptive statistics

* Analytic models

* Data visualization

The AI Data Pipeline is Sight Machine's intuitive data contextualization interface that helps you build digital twins in order to model data. The three main tasks required to create data models in the Sight Machine platform are mirrored in the main tabs in the AI Data Pipeline interface:

* **Raw Data: **Provides the tools for inspecting and visualizing raw data from facilities and machines.

* **Models: **Create and manage explicit-defined models, which will generate data-defined models such as cycles and downtimes.

* **Compute: **Allows you to recalculate data-defined models.

## Fundamental Data-Defined Models

* **Cycle: **A discrete transaction of a machine, during which the machine completes all of its operations on one piece, product, patient, file, etc. Also referred to as “machine cycle.”

* **Downtime: **A period of time that a system fails to provide or perform its primary function.

## Explicit and Hybrid-Defined Models

* **Facility: **An industrial site, usually consisting of buildings and machinery, or more commonly a complex having several buildings, where workers manufacture goods or operate machines processing one product into another.

* **Machine: **A piece of equipment with moving parts that performs tasks when it is given power.

* **Machine Type: **Machines are the core of any manufacturing operation. They come in many shapes and sizes, produce large volumes of data, and have a wide variety of inputs and outputs. However, manufacturers often have multiple machines of the same kind across their operations. Sight Machine understands this is a common occurrence, and as result, groups machines into Machine Types within the configuration.

## Accessing the Interface

In order to access the AI Data Pipeline interface, you will need an Admin user to assign you the Commander role.

**Admins Only - To grant users access to the interface:**

1. For Admins, navigate to your Sight Machine URL, and then open the main menu.

2. Click **Settings**.

3. Locate the user, and then check the **Commander** box.  

After the Admin has given you the correct role, you will see an AI Data Pipeline link in the Sight Machine main menu.

**To access the interface:**

1. On the main Sight Machine menu on the right, click **AI Data Pipeline**.

2. To return to the Sight Machine platform at any time, on the menu, click **Manufacturing Applications**.
