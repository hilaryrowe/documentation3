# Configuring Models {#docs-internal-guid-c351c58b-9ac9-92d7-27f6-6c814f13799f}

Model configuration is the core capability of the AI Data Pipeline. It provides an interface for you to define the configurations for each explicit-defined model, which will act as a set of instructions for the AI Data Pipeline as it produces your data-defined models.

Currently, we support the configuration of Facilities, Machine Types, and Machines. This is sufficient for the production of a Cycles model, a Downtimes model, and OEE metrics.

**NOTE:** In the near future, we will also support configuration of Part Types and Batch Types, which support our traceability models, Parts, and Batches.
