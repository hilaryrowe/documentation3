# Configuring a Machine

After you have defined much of the critical information in Machines Types, a Machine is a fairly straightforward configuration. Simply name your machine, identify the asset from FactoryTX that defines this Machine, and select the Machine Type and Facility to which the Machine belongs.

**To configure a Machine:**

1. On the top Models menu, click **Machines**.

11. For the next Machine you add, you will only see the assets that you have not yet associated with another Machine. In this example, Robot1 was selected previously, so only Robot2 appears in the Asset list.
