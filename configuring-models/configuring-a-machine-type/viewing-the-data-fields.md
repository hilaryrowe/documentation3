## Viewing the Data Fields

After you set up the cycle boundaries and classify the downtime reasons, you can check the data fields that you are working with.

**To view the data fields:**

2. On the Data Fields screen, check the list of all the raw data fields and their associated data streams. In either the Type or Function column, click a value to edit what you want to run on the raw data field to produce cycle data fields.

3. In the Data Fields column, you can click and rename any value. This determines how the fields appear in Manufacturing Applications.
