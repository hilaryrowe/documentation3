## Creating a New Machine Type

The first step in creating a new Machine Type is to provide a unique Machine Type name and select an Asset generated in FactoryTX. When you click the Configure button, the Sight Machine platform automatically inspects all of your raw data and generates the basic structure of your Machine Type. This may take a few seconds, depending on the amount of raw data being analyzed. After this runs, check that the list of Stream Types is what you expect. If not, you might want to revisit your FactoryTX configuration.
