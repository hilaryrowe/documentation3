## Creating a New Machine Type

The first step in creating a new Machine Type is to provide a unique Machine Type name and select an Asset generated in FactoryTX. When you click the Configure button, the Sight Machine platform automatically inspects all of your raw data and generates the basic structure of your Machine Type. This may take a few seconds, depending on the amount of raw data being analyzed. After this runs, check that the list of Stream Types is what you expect. If not, you might want to revisit your FactoryTX configuration.

**To create a new Machine Type:**

1. On the top Models menu, click **Machine Types**.

3. On the New Machine Type screen, you will need to set a scaffold to use as the template for this Machine Type. Type a name for the new Machine Type. This should be a user-friendly reference for the Machine Type that will appear in Manufacturing Applications.

4. Click the **Asset** field, and then in the window, select an asset that was uploaded from FactoryTX to use as the scaffold.

6. A status screen appears as the AI Data Pipeline automatically scans thousands of raw data records, and generates the basic layout of your new Machine Type.
