# Configuring a Machine Type

Machine Types are the core of the AI Data Pipeline, and for each customer machine, define how every bit of data will be processed by the Sight Machine platform. Think of Machine Type as a model for a set of machines that behave in the same way or have the same function.

When creating a new Machine Type, you will need to perform the following tasks:

* [Creating a New Machine Type](/configuring-models/configuring-a-machine-type/creating-a-new-machine-type.md)

* [Defining Cycle Boundaries](/configuring-models/configuring-a-machine-type/defining-cycle-boundaries.md)

* [Classifying Downtime Reasons](/configuring-models/configuring-a-machine-type/classifying-downtime-reasons.md)

* [Viewing the Data Fields](/configuring-models/configuring-a-machine-type/viewing-the-data-fields.md)

* [Deploying the Machine Type](/configuring-models/configuring-a-machine-type/deploying-the-machine-type.md)
