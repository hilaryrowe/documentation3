# Connecting to the User Interface

At this point in the deployment process, you should be able to connect to the user interface. This will enable the direct configuration of the system. To access this, you will need a connection to the device’s local network.

**To connect to the FactoryTX user interface:**

1. To get the local IP of the system, go into the device list for your application.
