# Setting Up Remote Debugging

Resin devices allow you to view of logs from the device, as well as SSH into the device, to debug.

There are also command-line interface \(CLI\) tools available if you prefer not to use the web interface. For more information, see: [https://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/](https://docs.resin.io/tools/cli/)

**To set up remote debugging:**

1. Click the name of a device in the list to select it.
